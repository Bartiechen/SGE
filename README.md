## SGE
 **Event Management System with control of frequency, certificates and declarations**

### Objective
During the school year, at the Federal University of Technology of Paraná -
campus Guarapuava - occurs several events. Thus, its necessary to control the
frequency of the participants,  base on these frequencies is issued the
certificates and declarations to the participants. Currently, this process is
doing manually, compromising time. In this way, the objective of this work is
to develop an automated and a semi-automated system to control the
participants' presence. These features will be coupled in an event management
system, that is developing by other final undergraduate work, in parallel with
this project. Initial results stand out as screen prototypes, functionality
workflow,  entity–relationship model and the users' roles. Thus, with the
development of this project, we hope to contribute to a better organization of
the events in the Federal University of Technology of Paraná - campus
Guarapuava.
